#🚗 Used Car Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the price of used cars using machine learning techniques based on various features such as car age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to build a reliable regression model that can estimate car prices with reasonable accuracy.

##📌 Problem Statement

Used car pricing depends on multiple factors and is often inconsistent. This project aims to analyze historical car data and apply machine learning models to predict fair market prices, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

##🧠 Approach

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing

Handled missing values and categorical features

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature impact

Applied regression-based machine learning models

Evaluated model performance using standard metrics

##🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-learn – model building and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook

##📊 Machine Learning Models

Linear Regression

(Optional if used: Random Forest / Decision Tree — you can add later)

##📈 Evaluation Metrics

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score
