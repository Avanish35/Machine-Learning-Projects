#🏡 Bangalore House Price Prediction

Predicting real-estate prices in Bengaluru using Machine Learning.

#📌 Overview

This project builds an ML model that predicts house prices in Bangalore based on features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
It cleans raw dataset chaos, engineers useful features, and trains a model that actually understands the city’s real-estate patterns.
